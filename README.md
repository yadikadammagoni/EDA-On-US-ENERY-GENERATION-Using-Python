# US Energy Generation Analysis
# Overview
This project analyzes US energy generation data from 2001 to 2022. It focuses on various energy sources, their correlations with state population, and average temperatures. The goal is to identify trends in energy production and understand how different factors influence energy generation.

# Dataset
The dataset includes:
YEAR: The year when the data was recorded.
MONTH: The month number when the data was recorded.
STATE: The US state where the data was recorded.
TYPE OF PRODUCER: The entity producing the energy (e.g., Electric Utilities).
ENERGY SOURCE: The type of energy source used (e.g., Hydroelectric, Wind).
GENERATION: Energy generated in Megawatt hours.
POP: State population.
AVERAGE_TEMP: Average temperature for the state.

# Project Goals
Integrate and clean data from multiple sources.
Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and correlations.
Visualize energy production patterns and state-specific insights.
# Conclusion
Through this project, we identified key trends in energy production, including which sources are most and least prevalent, and how they relate to state populations and temperatures. The analysis highlights significant patterns and provides insights into the effectiveness and distribution of different energy sources across the US.
